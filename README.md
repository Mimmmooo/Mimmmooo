# 📌 About Me

Hi, I’m **Selina Mim** 👋  
I enjoy solving problems in **mathematics, machine learning, and programming**, often blending academic theory with practical implementations.

## 🔎 Interests & Focus Areas
- 📘 **Mathematics**  
  - Linear Algebra (*Contemporary Linear Algebra* by Anton)  
  - Complex Analysis (*Fundamentals of Complex Analysis* by Saff)  
  - Probability, Statistics, and Markov Chains  

- 🤖 **Machine Learning & Data Analysis**  
  - Decision Trees (preferred for clarity & accuracy)  
  - Exploratory data analysis with **visualizations**  
  - Feature importance via **information gain**  
  - Simple regressions, aiming for interpretability and accuracy  

- 📊 **Projects & Datasets**  
  - **Bangladesh Districtwise Population Data**  
  - **CrimesOnWomenData.csv**  
  - **Customer Satisfaction Prediction** (22 features, train/test setup)  
  - Media bias & political sentiment analysis (Bangladesh, Danish AFINN, Telugu news, etc.)  

- 💻 **Programming & Problem Solving**  
  - Python (focus on easiest, clean BFS/DFS codes)  
  - SQL (schema explanation, relational design, queries)  
  - Competitive programming attempts (CF, C)  

---

## 🛠️ Preferences & Workflow
- Keep code **simple & explanatory**, with short explanations for each step.  
- Prefer **visual learning** through histograms, classy plots (using seaborn, matplotlib).  
- Minimal parameter tuning in ML — focus on **interpretability**.  
- Use **descriptive, inferential, exploratory, predictive, causal, and mechanistic questions** for structured analysis.

## 🚀 Current Work
- Studying and applying math-heavy ML concepts.  
- Exploring **media bias detection and sentiment analysis** across languages.  
- Developing clean solutions for **graph algorithms** and **probability/statistics problems**.
